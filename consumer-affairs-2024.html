      <div class="question">

          <span class="question-text">Explain the various forms of market structures, their merits and demerits.</span>
        </div>
        <div class="answer">
          <p>Market structure means how different markets are organised based on number of buyers and sellers, product nature, entry barriers, and competition level. There are mainly four forms: Perfect Competition, Monopoly, Monopolistic Competition, and Oligopoly.</p>

          <p><strong>(i) Perfect Competition:</strong><br>
          Perfect competition is an ideal market where there are many sellers and buyers selling identical products. There is free entry and exit, and prices are decided by market demand and supply.</p>

          <p><strong>Merits:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>Buyers get goods at lowest price due to competition.</li>
            <li>There is efficient allocation of resources.</li>
            <li>Consumers have full information about prices and products.</li>
            <li>There is no wastage of resources.</li>
          </ul>

          <p><strong>Demerits:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>It is unrealistic; rarely found in real life.</li>
            <li>Sellers cannot earn abnormal profits.</li>
            <li>Innovation is discouraged because firms can't charge extra.</li>
            <li>Too much competition may create instability.</li>
          </ul>

          <p><strong>(ii) Monopoly:</strong><br>
          Monopoly exists when a single seller controls the entire market with no close substitute. Entry of new firms is restricted due to patents, control over raw materials, or legal protection.</p>

          <p><strong>Merits:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>Large-scale production benefits like economies of scale.</li>
            <li>High profits can be used for research and development.</li>
            <li>Stable prices because only one seller fixes the price.</li>
          </ul>

          <p><strong>Demerits:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>Consumers have no choice and may pay high prices.</li>
            <li>Exploitation of consumers is possible due to price control.</li>
            <li>Poor quality may result due to lack of competition.</li>
            <li>Monopolies may become inefficient.</li>
          </ul>

          <p><strong>(iii) Monopolistic Competition:</strong><br>
          In this structure, there are many sellers selling similar but differentiated products. Examples are soaps, toothpaste, clothes etc. Firms differentiate their products through branding, quality, and packaging.</p>

          <p><strong>Merits:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>Consumers get variety of products.</li>
            <li>New firms can enter easily.</li>
            <li>Innovation and advertising are encouraged.</li>
            <li>Consumers enjoy better services.</li>
          </ul>

          <p><strong>Demerits:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>Heavy expenditure on advertising increases cost.</li>
            <li>Excess capacity and wastage of resources.</li>
            <li>Prices may be higher than in perfect competition.</li>
            <li>Misleading advertisements may confuse buyers.</li>
          </ul>

          <p><strong>(iv) Oligopoly:</strong><br>
          Oligopoly is a market where a few large firms dominate. Products may be homogeneous (e.g., steel, cement) or differentiated (e.g., cars, mobile phones).</p>

          <p><strong>Merits:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>Firms enjoy huge economies of scale.</li>
            <li>Product quality improves due to competition among few.</li>
            <li>Price stability is possible through price leadership.</li>
            <li>Companies spend on R&D and better technology.</li>
          </ul>

          <p><strong>Demerits:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>Price collusion is possible, harming consumers.</li>
            <li>Difficult for new firms to enter due to high cost.</li>
            <li>Firms may form cartels to fix prices.</li>
            <li>Advertising costs may mislead consumers.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>In India, different sectors follow different market structures. Agriculture shows features of perfect competition, power companies show monopoly, consumer goods follow monopolistic competition, and oil, steel industries show oligopoly.</p>

          <p>Understanding market structures helps policymakers, businesses, and consumers to make better decisions.</p>

          <p><strong>(i) Corporate Redressal System:</strong><br>

          <span class="question-number">4️⃣</span>
          <span class="question-text">Explain the BIS Hallmarking Scheme and its benefits for customers and society.</span>
        </div>
        <div class="answer">
          <p>BIS Hallmarking is a certification scheme for gold and silver jewellery. The Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) runs this scheme.</p>

          <p><strong>Meaning:</strong><br>
          Hallmark means marking jewellery with a stamp to show purity and quality. BIS introduced it to protect buyers from fraud and ensure they get pure metal.</p>

          <p><strong>Features:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>BIS certifies only licensed jewellers.</li>
            <li>It checks the metal's purity in certified labs.</li>
            <li>Hallmark shows BIS logo, fineness number, jeweller's mark, and year.</li>
          </ul>

          <p><strong>Benefits for customers:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>Ensures accurate purity of gold or silver.</li>
            <li>Protects from fake or sub-standard jewellery.</li>
            <li>Increases trust in branded jewellers.</li>
            <li>Helps resale value; easy to sell or mortgage.</li>
            <li>Government compensation if cheating is proved.</li>
          </ul>

          <p><strong>Benefits for society:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>Promotes ethical trade practices.</li>
            <li>Reduces black marketing of impure gold.</li>
            <li>Generates employment for assaying centres and certified shops.</li>
            <li>Boosts India's export image for quality jewellery.</li>
          </ul>

          <p><strong>Legal Mandate:</strong><br>
          In June 2021, hallmarking was made mandatory in over 256 districts in India. Non-hallmarked jewellery sales are illegal in these areas.</p>

          <p><strong>Challenges:</strong><br>
          Some rural areas still lack awareness. Small jewellers find it costly to get license.</p>

          <p><strong>Conclusion:</strong><br>
          BIS Hallmarking builds confidence, ensures consumer rights and makes the jewellery sector fair and transparent.</p>

          More benches are opened for faster hearings. E-filing and video hearings help solve pending cases quickly.</p>

          These recent developments show the government's serious effort to protect consumers. They help buyers trust sellers, encourage fair trade, and keep the market safe.</p>

            <li>If a complaint is not solved by CGRF, it goes to the Ombudsman appointed by SERC.</li>
          </ul>
